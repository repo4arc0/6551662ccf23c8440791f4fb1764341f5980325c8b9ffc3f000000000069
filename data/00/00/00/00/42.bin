00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,930
所以别给他机会反抗！
So don't wait to see if he's a fighter!

158
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,850
麻醉他 把他带回来
Tranq him and bring him back.

159
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,930
加密中，进度：

160
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,150
加密完成。呼入消息……

161
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,130
<蓝先生--

162
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,130
好消息

163
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,710
血样初步检测结果显示
伽玛水平已明显下降

164
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,300
能治好我吗？

165
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,350
可以

166
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,460
不过…

167
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,460
我需要更多数据

168
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,140
噢  拜托
Oh, come on.

169
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,360
暴露程度、伽玛粒子浓度
细胞饱和度

170
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,330
不可能，数据不在这里。

171
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,910
那在哪里？

172
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:05,670
在家。

173
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,210
摄像头
Camera.

174
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,960
开始吧
Here we go.

175
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,140
别惊动那只狗
Get rid of the damn dog.

176
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,030
抓住他
Take him!

177
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,670
目标逃跑了
Target's on the move.

178
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,430
他在哪儿？
Where is he?

179
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,020
他在下面
He's on the ground.

180
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,850
- 走！ - 快！
- Let's go! - COMMANDO: Go!

181
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,980
快，快！
Move, move!

182
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,110
谢谢

183
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,960
走,快,快！
Go, go, go!

184
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,880
快,快!
Go! Go!

185
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,550
动作快！
COMMANDO: Clear everyone out!

186
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,970
别跟丢了！
Do not lose him!

187
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,060
哦！不！
Oh! No!

188
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,970
绕到他后面去！
Get around behind him!

189
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:30,140
目标出现了 刚刚经过指挥车
Target moving past mobile unit 0-9-0.

190
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,030
哦，不是吧
Oh, no.

191
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,240
别开玩笑了
You got to be kidding me.

192
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,110
- 他在哪？  - 目标还在
- GENERAL ON RADIO: Where is he? - Target acquired.

193
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,120
外国佬！
MAN: Gringo!

194
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,640
我们走
(WHISPERING) Let's go.

195
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,450
不！
No!

196
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,780
混蛋
BRUCE: Please! No!

197
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,620
电脑！
Not the computer!

198
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,240
还给我！不！
Gimme that! No!

199
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,110
现在怎么不硬了，嗯？

200
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,490
再耍耍那些招数啊

201
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,450
来啊

202
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,530
请别这样

203
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,240
我…愤怒…

204
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,410
很严重

205
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,970
你很恐怖 我更恐怖
You bad angry, G?I very bad angry.

206
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:42,850
哦不
Oh, no.

207
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,780
你不明白！这个地方会有大麻烦的！
You don't understand! Something really bad is about to happen here!

208
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,970
是啊，很严重

209
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,840
有人看到过吗？
(WHISPERING) Anybody else seeing this?

210
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,870
发现不明物体，请指示
COMMANDO 1: We've got a bogey of some kind. Please advice.

211
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,920
那个就是目标！快使用麻醉枪！
That is the target!Use every tranq you've got!

212
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,540
马上射击！
Do it now!

213
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,680
用实弹，用实弹！
Go live! Go live! Go live!

214
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,560
- 用实弹！  - 快走！
COMMANDO 1: Move! COMMANDO 2: Get out of the way!

215
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,220
不！
No!

216
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:36,340
快走 动作快 快 快
COMMANDO 2: It's behind us! Move! Move!

217
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,230
射击！
COMMANDO 1: Get him!

218
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,060
集中火力  快！
Shoot!

219
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:06,040
离我远点
HULK: Leave me alone.

220
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,530
不！不！
No! No!

221
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,500
开枪前我就知道有问题
I knew something was different before I got the shot off.

222
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,920
他逃走时留下这个
He had it on him when he bolted.

223
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:45,390
是他女朋友？是她在帮他？
Is that a girlfriend? She helps him, maybe?

224
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,270
这女孩不是问题
She is no longer a factor.

225
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,810
他们早不联系了 那小子是一个人
We closed that door to him a long time ago.He's alone.

226
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,940
他喜欢单干 查查他都和谁有联系
He wants to be alone.But see if he's been talking to anybody.

227
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,370
恕我冒昧，长官
Forgive me, sir?

228
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,870
难道没人想谈谈刚才发生的事吗
Doesn't anybody want to talk about what went down in there? 'Cause...

229
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:15,710
我们包围了他
He didn't lose us.

230
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:19,590
而他并不是一个人，长官，我们困住他
And he was not alone, sir. We had him.

231
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,010
只是后来被一个
And then something hit us, something...

232
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,930
一个很大的 大家伙
Something big hit us!

233
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:30,230
那家伙 像扔垒球一样把叉车扔过来
It threw a forklift truck like it was a softball!

234
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:35,900
这是我 从没见过的力量
It was the most powerful thing I've ever seen.

235
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,400
他不见了
Well, it's gone.

236
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,400
如果班纳知道那是什么
Well, if Banner knows what it is,

237
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:45,620
我会把他抓住 用遍所有酷刑
I'm gonna track him down,I'm gonna put my foot on his throat

238
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,530
－逼他说出来 －那就是班纳
- and I'm gonna... - That was Banner.

239
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,500
那怪物
It

240
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,540
就是班纳
was Banner.

241
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,840
- 你必须得解释清楚，长官  - 没这必要
- You have to explain that statement, sir. - No, I don't.

242
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,090
你表现得很好
You've done a good job.

243
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:10,770
收拾一下叫所有人上飞机，我们回家了
Pack up and get our men on a plane.We're going home.

244
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:03,820
无事故发生天数

245
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,330
等等
Wait.

246
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,250
等等
Please.

247
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,490
能帮我个忙吗？

248
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,120
你怎么光着身子

249
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,090
我 这个呃
Where am I?

250
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,450
这是 这是哪儿？

251
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,330
瓜地马拉

252
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,340
前面有个镇子 现在我正要过去

253
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,880
你能带我一段吗？

254
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,300
上车 我先带你去镇子

255
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,470
披上

256
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,190
你要去哪儿？

257
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,320
我要回家

258
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:07,510
我以前执行任务的时候也出过差错
BLONSKY: I've run into bad situations on crap missions before.

259
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,720
优秀士兵
I've seen good men go down

260
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,050
在不知情的情况下，就那么白白的牺牲了
purely because someone didn't let us know what we were walking into.

261
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,510
可我是军人 必须战斗下去 对吗
I've moved on to the next one,because that's what we do, right?

262
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,970
军人的天职
I mean, that's the job.

263
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,270
可这次？
But this?

264
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:21,940
实在超出我的想象
This is a whole new level of weird.

265
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,900
我不能就这样当作没发生过
And I don't feel inclined to step away from it.

266
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,030
如果你还要去抓他，算我一个
So if you're taking another crack at him,I want in.

267
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:31,950
带着我的尊敬，我必须说，下一次一定要做好万全的准备
And, with respect, you should be looking for a team that's prepped and ready to fight,

268
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,120
因为那家伙一旦出现
because if that thing shows up again,

269
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,910
不管是多英勇的战士都会吓得尿裤子
you're gonna have a lot of professional tough guys pissing in their pants.

270
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,670
长官
Sir.

271
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,370
恰帕斯-墨西哥

272
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:33,010
比这更大的有吗？
Tienes mas stretchy?

273
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,060
谢谢了
Yeah. Perfecto.

274
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,550
现在我要告诉你的
Let me emphasise that what I'm about to share with you

275
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:13,970
属于绝对机密而且很敏感 对我和军方都一样
is tremendously sensitive,both to me personally and the Army.

276
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,010
你应该听说过国家的步兵武器研发计划
You're aware that we've got an Infantry Weapons Development programme.

277
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:24,730
在二战的时候，他们就进行了各式各样新的实验
Well, in WWll, they initiated a subprogram

278
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,400
为了能提高士兵作战能力
for Bio-Tech Force Enhancement.

279
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,270
超级士兵
Yeah, Super Soldier.

280
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,820
没错
Yes.

281
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,910
虽然没这么简单 但没错
An oversimplification, but yes.

282
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:40,660
我命令他们再次进行更为大胆的实验
And I dusted it off, got 'em doing serious work again, bold work.

283
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,460
研发部只想要好武器
Across the hall,they were trying to arm you better.

284
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,750
而我想要好士兵
We were tryin' to make you better.

285
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:54,510
班纳的实验只是达到了初步阶段 根本还无法进入实际应用
Banner's work was very early phase.It wasn't even weapons application.

286
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:57,180
他以为他在研究抗辐射的方法
He thought he was working on radiation resistance.

287
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:00,470
而我从来就没有告诉过他真相
I would never have told him what the project really was.

288
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:05,190
可他过于相信自己，竟然私自进行了人体试验
But he was so sure of what he was onto,that he tested it on himself.

289
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:08,060
然后 出了大麻烦
And something went very wrong.

290
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,400
也可以不称为麻烦
Or it went very right.

291
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:17,320
我开始担心 他的身体属于军方财产
As far as I'm concerned, that man's whole body is the property of the US Army.

292
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:20,370
你说 他不是研发武器的 是吗
You said he wasn't working on weapons, right?

293
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,580
- 对  - 而你们在
- No. - But you were. You were, weren't you?

294
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,660
进行别的实验
You were trying other things.

295
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,620
一种血清 我们研发的
One serum we developed

296
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,210
很有潜力
was very promising.

297
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,920
- 他为什么逃跑？ - 他是科学家
- So why did he run? - He's a scientist.

298
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,130
不是军人
He is not one of us.

299
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:43,560
- 你现在几岁了？45？  - 39
- Blonsky, how old are you? 45? - 39.

300
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:47,940
- 打仗老得快 对吗？  - 是的 没错
- It takes a toll, doesn't it? - Yes, it does.

301
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,270
那就别出任务了
So get out of the trenches.

302
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,820
以你的记录当个上校没问题
You should be a Colonel by now,with your record.

303
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:56,150
不，我是战士，只要我还能战斗
No, I'm a fighter.I'll be one for as long as I can.

304
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,450
如果在十年前我就有了现在的经验
You know, if I could take what I know now,put it in the body I had ten years ago,

305
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:02,280
没准我天天想着退休
that would be someone I wouldn't want to fight.

306
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,160
我有办法让你变得更强
I could probably arrange something like that.

00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,610
所有你听到的 都不是真的
whatever you've heard about me,it's not true.

315
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,870
哦 我知道 我一直都不相信
Oh, I know it. I always knew it.

316
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:50,700
我是说 我了解你们俩
I mean, you know how I felt about you two.

317
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,540
- 你找过她了吗？  - 没有

她不知道我在这儿
She doesn't know that I'm here.

- She's with somebody? - Yeah, he's a head shrink.

320
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:08,550
听说是最顶尖的 倒是个不错的人
They say he's one of the best.But a really nice guy.

321
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,480
哦 很好 那很好
Good. That's good.

322
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:18,400
- 布鲁斯 我能帮你什么吗？  - 我需要地方住几晚
- Bruce, what can I do to help you? - I could use a bed for a few nights.

323
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,360
- 噢 你可以用楼上的空房间  - 那真是太好了
- You can have the spare room upstairs. - That'd be so great.

326
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:35,330
借过
Coming through.

327
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,880
嘿，老兄，五楼的外卖
Hey, pal. I got a delivery on five.

328
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,300
五楼的人都走光了
I don't think there's anybody up there.

329
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:48,840
啊 天啊 收不到钱我就惨了 拜托 让我去看看
Oh, man. I'm gonna catch hell if I don't collect. You got to let me try.

330

没有数据…

352
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,040
我就帮不了你了

353
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,440
现在准备怎么样？

354
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:06,230
我还得继续逃命

355
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:22,830
对不起 我们已经关门了 抱歉
We're pretty well closed here, folks.I'm sorry.

356
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:25,330
噢，拜托，斯丹利，今天可是周五
Oh, come on, Stan. It's Friday night.

357
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,210
孩子
Oh, kids.

358

我只剩下意大利番茄酱了
I got nothing but marinara now.

359
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,010
我一定要吃块披萨 求你
Oh, I got to have a Mister Pink, please.

360
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:35,300
她忙着工作 又没吃饭
She worked through dinner again,of course.

361
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,140
斯丹利
Stan?

362
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,900
然后我去了 所以 所以 是啊 我说 你在哪儿
And he... I go, " So, yeah,I mean, where were you?

363
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,030
我根本不知道你在哪儿
"I can't... I don't know where you were, Cecil."

364
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:54,610
他说 我没在你那儿
And he goes, "Not where you been at."

365
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:58,410
我说 我的天哪 我真拿他没办法
I thought, "Oh, my God." I just felt so awful.

366
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,400
布鲁斯
Bruce?

367
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:37,030
贝蒂 出什么事了
Betty? What's going on?

368
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,510
贝蒂…
Betty...

369
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:56,670
告诉我 我看到的是真的吗
Just tell me if I saw what I think I saw.

370
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:01,680
- 我不知道该怎么说  - 求你 请你告诉我实话
- I don't know what to say. - Please, just tell me the truth.

371
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:45,680
别走 别走
BETTY: Don't go. Don't go.

372
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:57,490
我要你现在跟我走
I want you to come with me now.

373
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:59,780
求你了，跟我走
Please. Come with me.

374
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,450
求你了
Please.

375
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,110
这是资料
BETTY: It's our data.

376
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:38,070
我是在他们搜查前拿出来的
I got in there before they carted it all away.

377
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,990
希望将来有一天 它能派上用场
I hoped somewhere that it might tell us something someday.

378
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:51,000
- 将军知道这件事吗？  - 不 应该不知道
- Does the General know that you have this? - No, I don't think so.

379
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,420
要知道我已经有两年没跟他说话了
I haven't spoken to him in a couple of years.

380
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,000
你一定要确定
You have to be sure.

381
00:43:55,090 --> 00:44:00,130
布鲁斯，我不明白为什么我们俩不能直接去找他 跟他谈谈
Bruce, I don't understand why we can't just go in there together and talk to him.

382
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:05,180
他告诉过我 他想干嘛 他想要取出我的细胞
He told me what he wanted to do.He wants it out of me.

383
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:08,520
对细胞进行分析后再复制它
He wants to dissect it so that he can replicate it.

384
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,770
他想让它成为武器
He wants to make it a weapon.

385
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,030
- 嗨  - 嗨

387
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:14,540
听着 嗯 我想尽快离开 越快越好
Listen, I should leave early,as early as I can.

388
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:18,040
真吗？不能留下吗？
Really? You can't stay at all?

389
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:21,460
我想留下 可是我留在这儿不安全
I want to,but it's just not safe for me to be here.

390
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:26,760
- 我想 跟你借点钱  - 没问题
- If I could borrow some cash... - Of course.

391
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,470
我要坐公车
I need to take a bus.

392
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:31,260
那 至少让我把你送到车站
Well, at least let me walk you to the station.

393
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,350
好的
Okay.

394
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:40,690
- 事情都办好了？  - 对
- You have everything you need? - Yeah.

395
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:44,940
I...

396
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,450
班纳
What?

397
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,910
- 晚安  - 晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

398
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:54,000
愿你睡个好觉
I hope you get some rest.

399
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,750
我们会给你注射很小的剂量
We're giving you a very low dose only.

400
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,750
你要时刻保持清醒配合我们
I need you sharp out there and disciplined.

401
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,840
只要出现副作用
First sign of any side effect

402
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,590
我们会马上停止 你在恢复之前要绝对保密
we stop and you're off team until you straighten out.

403
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,140
- 同意吗  - 同意
- Agreed? - Agreed.

404
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,810
我们将分两次给你注射
You'll get two separate infusions.

405
00:46:56,890 --> 00:47:01,100
先是深层肌肉 然后是骨髓注射
One into the deep muscle,one into the bone marrow centres.

406
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:03,480
第二针会很疼
The bone ones are going to hurt.

407
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:51,860
应该没什么事吧？
Is everything okay?

408
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,200
我想是的
I think so.

409
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,920
过来 干嘛
Come here.

410
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:08,630
- 我帮你拉出来  - 哦
- I just wanna do this. - Oh.

411
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,880
- 这样会好看点  - 对
- It's better like that. - Yeah?

412
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,180
帽子太小了
It feels too tight, huh?

413
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:20,060
- 是有点紧  - 没关系
- Yeah, a little. - Okay.

414
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,530
- 怎么了  - 他们来了
- What? - They're here.

415
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:32,280
- 贝蒂，看着我，看着我！  - 布鲁斯！
- Betty, look at me, look at me! - Bruce!

416
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,610
你一定要尽可能的离我远一点儿
You have to go far away from me as you can!

417
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,200
- 越远越好 快点儿 快  - 布鲁斯！
- Don't argue with me, just go. Go! - Bruce!

418
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,500
见鬼 狙击手三分钟
Damn it! We'd have had snipers on target in three more minutes.

419
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:50,130
就能解决的问题 是谁打草惊蛇了
I wanna know who jumped the gun.

420
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:53,590
他在270方向
He's heading 2-7-0.

421
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:12,400
布朗斯基！先等一下！
Blonsky! Not yet!

422
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,030
是
Sir.

423
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,280
注意 有好戏看了
Look alive. This could get interesting.

424
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:07,370
他在那儿
I got him!

425
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:10,750

Stop! Stop!

426

我知道你在里面！
I know you're in there!

427
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,430
将军 求你了
General, please!

428
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:20,970
长官
Sir?

429
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,680
爸爸！
Dad!

430
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:34,280
- 爸爸，求你放了他吧  - 你根本就不明白 去里面呆着
- Dad, please don't do this. - You can't see this clearly. Now, get inside.

431
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,190
他在那儿
There he is!

432
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,490
目标在天桥 请指示
SOLDIER 1 ON RADIO,Target is in the overpass. We have a visual.

433
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:40,740

Do not engage! Repeat, do not engage!

434

他被关起来了

Get her back here!

438
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:53,100
现在她明白了
Now she'll see.

439
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,090
阿尔法小组
Alpha team?

440
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:20,170
集中火力射击
Let him have all of it.

441
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:27,930
集中火力 集中火力
SOLDIER 2: Come on, light him up!

442
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:34,520
大口径机枪在哪儿 快给我上啊
Where are the fifty cals? Move your asses!

443
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:23,900
哦，我的天啊
Oh, my God!

444
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:28,580
布朗斯基，该你了！
Blonsky, now you're up!

445
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,410
长官？
Sir?

446
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:32,870
掩护我
Cover me.

447
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:52,470
记得我吗？
Remember me?

448
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:13,830
天呐 他竟然没事
My God, he's doing it.

449
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,210
引他到声波炮
Move him toward the cannons!

450
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:27,430
快！ 保持队形
SOLDIER: Move!

451
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:42,190
稳住
Hold your position!

452
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:43,610
开炮 快
BLONSKY: Do it now!

453
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:11,010
求你 求你 求求你了
Please, please, please, no!

454
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:12,510
- 求求你了！   - 把她给我抓住
- Please, please, please! - Get her back!

455
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,640
你会杀了他的！
You're killing him!

456
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,060
快停下！放开我！
BETTY: Stop! Get off of me!

457
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,560
布鲁斯！
(DISTORTED) Bruce!

458
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:24,660
布鲁斯！
Bruce! Bruce!

459
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:55,070
武装直升机呢？
Where's the gunship?

460
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:16,340
就这些吗
Is that it?

461
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:18,340
布朗斯基，马上给我撤退
Blonsky, pull back now.

462
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:19,720
撤退
Pull back!

463
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:24,640
就这点儿本事
Is that all you got?

464
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:34,780
- 撤退 - 撤退 快走 快走
-Fall back! -SOLDIER 3: Fall back! Let's go, let's go!

465
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:36,240
找掩护！
GENERAL: Find cover!

466
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,450
贝蒂！
Betty!

467
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,420
快开火，该死的！
Fire, goddamn it!

468
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:59,430
布鲁斯？
Bruce?

469
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,810
停止射击
Stop firing!

470
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:28,790
不！
No!

471
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,470
你通知我是对的
You did the right thing, calling us.

472
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:26,510
我要知道他们去哪里了
I need to know where they're going.

473
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,760
贝蒂跟他在一起非常危险
She'll be in incredible danger as long as she's with him.

474
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:30,140
谁造成的
From who?

475
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:33,640
他保护了她，而你差点杀了她
He protected her. You almost killed her.

476
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:37,480
我向你发誓 我比任何人都更关心贝蒂的安全
I give you my word, her safety is my main concern at this point.

477
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:40,280
知道吗 身为专业的精神科医生
You know, it's a point of professional pride with me

478
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:43,280
我看得出到底谁在说谎
that I can always tell when somebody's lying.

479
00:58:43,610 --> 00:58:44,700
你在说谎
And you are.

480
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:48,240
他在哪儿我不知道
I don't know where he's going.

481
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:53,370
- 可我知道贝蒂会尽力帮他  - 她是协助逃犯
-I know she'll help him, if she can. -Then she's aiding a fugitive.

482
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:57,210
那样的话我也帮不了他们
And I can't help either one of them.

483
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:05,340
我一直在想她为什么从不提起你
I used to wonder why she never talked about you.

484
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,090
现在我知道了！
Now I know!

485
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:14,350
这些家伙她都怎么认识的
GENERAL: Where does she meet these guys?

486
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:05,030
布鲁斯？
Bruce?

487
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:16,410
布鲁斯
Bruce.

488
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,770
没事的 没事的
It's okay. It's okay.

489
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:54,660
你过来 到这边来
Come here. Come this way.

490
01:00:57,870 --> 01:00:59,500
小心头
Watch your head.

491
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,720
Okay.

492
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:27,690
我们没事了
We're okay.

493
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:33,990
没事了
It's okay.

494
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:37,540
只是下雨
It's just the rain.

495
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,010
他还能走路吗？
GENERAL: Will he ever walk again?

496
01:01:49,090 --> 01:01:52,680
现在他全身的骨头没有一片是完整的
DOCTOR: Most of the bones in his body look like crushed gravel right now.

497
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,560
我很佩服他 他的心脏非常强健
I will say this for him.He's got a heart like a machine.

498
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,850
我从没见过这样的 就像赛马一样
Never seen anything like it,outside of a racehorse.

499
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:03,540
来
Here.

500
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,250
好了
Okay.

501
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:48,130
布鲁斯？
Bruce?

502
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:50,880
噢 嗨
Oh, hi.

503
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:52,590
你还好吧？
Are you okay?

504
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:54,340
是啊
Yeah.

505
01:03:54,550 --> 01:03:56,800
是啊 现在我好多了
Yeah, actually, I feel a lot better.

506
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,470
- 很好  - 我得把资料取出来
-Good. -I just had to get my data back.

507
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:02,140
你把它吞了
You ate it?

508
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:06,480
哇 当时… 我也是被逼急了 总得想办法
Well, you know, the circumstances called for a little improvisation.

509
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:07,650
哇
Wow.

510
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:13,480
好吧 适合你的衣服不算多 我帮你选了几件
Okay, so they didn't have a great selection,but I got you some options.

511
01:04:13,570 --> 01:04:16,150
这个比较重要
First thing's first.

512
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,860
哦 真有你的
Oh, you're kidding me.

513
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:29,250
怎么了
What?

514
01:04:29,830 --> 01:04:32,670
- 不要  - 这可是弹性最好的裤子
-No. -They were the stretchiest pair they had.

515
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:34,090
我还是穿普通的吧
I'll take my chances.

516
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:36,800
目前外界正广泛流传美国军方
FEMALE REPORTER.; Rumours continue to swirl about a violent clash

517
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,680
进行了一场十分残酷的激战 然而对手来历不明
between forces of the US military and an unknown adversary

518
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:43,720
地点是卡尔弗大学 时间是今天清晨
on the campus of Culver University earlier today.

519
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:47,060
两位该校大学生 目睹了整个事件的过程
Sophomores Jack McGhee and Jim Wilson witnessed some of the battle.

520
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:48,600
那个大家伙超级大
JIM.; It was so big.

521
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:51,560
- 就像是 巨人浩克  - 对
-It was like this huge, like, hulk! -Yeah.

522
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:54,690
其中的一名学生是校报的记者
FEMALE REPORTER.; McGhee, who happens to be a reporter for the campus paper,

523
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:56,490
这些是他用手机拍下来的画面
captured this on his cell phone.

524
01:04:56,570 --> 01:04:58,280
因为一场雷暴雨的突然到来
Further search for the mysterious ''hulk''

525
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:02,870
所以推迟了在森林公园搜索这个神秘浩克的行动
was postponed by powerful thunderstorms in the Smoky Mountain National Forest.

526
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:06,370
汽车旅馆

527
01:05:10,370 --> 01:05:13,340
后面别剪太短 好吗
Not too short back there.

528
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:15,880
我以前也帮你剪过头发
I have done this before, you know.

529
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:34,360
我都不知道这段时间你自己是怎么剪的
I don't know how you've done this on your own for all this time.

530
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,360
通常都是用电推刀
With clippers, usually.

531
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:33,920
- 等等 等等 等等- 怎么？
-Wait, wait, wait. Wait. -What? What?

532
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,380
我们不能这样
We can't do this.

533
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:37,540
- 没事的，我想你  - 不
-It's okay. I want to. -No.

534
01:06:38,590 --> 01:06:39,670
No.

535
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,090
我不能
I can't .

536
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,640
我不能太兴奋了
I can't get too excited.

537
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:52,430
难道一点点都不行吗
Not even a little excited?

538
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:56,480
没关系
BETTY: It's okay.

539
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:03,030
长官 布朗斯基
Sir, it's Blonsky.

540
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:08,450
有人找到他的家人或者亲戚吗
Has anyone found out if he has next of kin or family?

541
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:10,910
你自己问他吧
Ask him yourself.

542
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:15,790
长官
Sir?

543
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:39,980
- 很高兴看到你恢复 士兵  - 谢谢 长官
-Good to see you back on your feet, soldier. -Thank you, sir.

544
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:48,200
感觉怎么样
How do you feel?

545
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,580
准备好开始第三回合了
Pissed off and ready for round three.

546
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:03,010
－怎么了 －基本上这些都不能用  会被追踪的
Basically, we can't use any of this,because they can track all of it.

547
01:08:03,090 --> 01:08:05,880
你是说我的唇膏也会被追踪吗
Well, my lip gloss? Can they track that?

548
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:09,970
- 不 这个你可以拿着  - 谢谢
-No. You can take your lip gloss. -Thank you.

549
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:12,970
- 我需要我的眼镜  - 你可以把眼镜
-Well, I need my glasses. -Well, you can take

550
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:14,220
和手表拿去 好吗
-your glasses and your watch, okay? -Okay.

551
01:08:14,310 --> 01:08:17,940
大多数可以用 信用卡或者手机 有身份识别的
We can use most of it. We just can't use the credit cards, the ID or the phone.

552
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:20,310
- 你最好都别用 - 好的
-Don't even turn that on. -Okay.

553
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:22,570
显然我们只能用现金
And we'll take the cash, obviously.

554
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:26,570
我们没有信用卡 只靠40块的现金能怎么逃亡
How will we get where we need to go on $40 and no credit cards?

555
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:32,490
噢，可以把这个卖了
Well, we could sell this.

556
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:36,120
不 不 这是你妈妈唯一留给你的东西  不
No. No, that's the only thing you have left from her. No.

557
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:41,040
以后一定能把它赎回来
Well, we'll have to try and get it back.

558
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:43,630
调查局已经对罗斯博士的手机
SPARR: Federal is already monitoring phones,

559
01:08:43,710 --> 01:08:45,970
还有网络账号进行了监控
plastic and Dr Ross's web accounts,

560
01:08:46,050 --> 01:08:48,300
当地警方也设下了临时检查站
and local PD have been placed on alert.

561
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:51,050
他们只要出现 就会立刻通知我们
They'll pop up somewhere and when they do, it comes straight to us.

562
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:53,100
他们不会束手就擒的
GENERAL: They're not gonna just pop up.

563
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:56,230
他这五年来一直都在各个国家逃亡
He made it five years and got across borders without making any mistakes.

564
01:08:56,310 --> 01:08:58,140
是绝对不会使用信用卡的
He's not gonna use a damn credit card now.

565
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,310
如果他想逃 一定会去
If he was trying to escape, he'd be long gone.

566
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,560
远的地方
He's not trying to escape this time.

567
01:09:01,650 --> 01:09:04,150
他现在肯定是在寻求帮助 这才是我们的机会
He's looking for help and that's how we're gonna get him.

568
01:09:04,230 --> 01:09:06,650
他一定会和别人联系
We know what they're after and we know he's been talking to somebody.

569
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:08,570
在他的电脑里 我们发现了一些很重要的对话
You all have copies of the correspondence.

570
01:09:09,070 --> 01:09:11,120
蓝先生跟绿先生的匿称
The aliases Mr Green and Mr Blue

571
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,330
已经被输入到神盾局的资料库里
have been added to the SHIELD Operations Database.

572
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:17,250
蓝先生，附上数据


是时候见面了






-绿先生

573
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:16,040
我们已经做好了一切准备
If he comes up for air, we'll be waiting.

574
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:19,500
如果他发信号 就会暴露
If he makes a peep, we'll hear him.

575
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:22,000
他一疏忽 我们就动手
And when he slips up, we'll be ready.

嘿
Hey.

585
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,050
笑一个
Smile.

586
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:21,140
那是什么感觉？
What is it like?

587
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:25,810
变身后的感觉是什么样的
When it happens, what do you experience?

588
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:29,150
你还记得我们在哈佛大学自愿参与的
Remember those experiments we volunteered for at Harvard?

589
01:10:29,230 --> 01:10:31,320
引导幻觉试验吗？
Those induced hallucinations?

590
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:35,490
就像那个一样，但是被放大了一千倍
It's a lot like that,just a thousand times amplified.

591
01:10:37,330 --> 01:10:41,250
就好像是吃了一公斤的迷魂药
It's like someone's poured a litre of acid into my brain.

592
01:10:41,330 --> 01:10:46,170
- 还记得发生了什么？  - 只有一些很零星的画面
-Do you remember anything? -Just fragments. Images.

593
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:49,840
太多的噪音 我什么也分不清楚
There's too much noise.I can never derive anything out of it.

594
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:53,510
- 那么你的意识 还在它里面  - 不，并没有
-But then it's still you inside it. -No. No, it's not.

595
01:10:55,930 --> 01:11:00,100
我不明白，那天在山洞里，你就好像认识我一样
I don't know.In the cave, I really felt like it knew me.

596
01:11:00,850 --> 01:11:02,270
也许那时你大脑超载
Maybe your mind is in there,

597
01:11:02,350 --> 01:11:04,980
不清楚到底过程是什么样的
it's just overcharged and can't process what's happening.

598
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:08,360
我不想控制它，我只想摆脱它
I don't want to control it.I want to get rid of it.

599
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:23,040
准备好了？
Are you ready?

600
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,870
这样才旗鼓相当
Let's even the playing field a little.

601
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:29,590
开始吧
Gentlemen.

602
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:37,220
布鲁斯，快醒醒，情况不太妙
BETTY: Bruce, wake up.There's something going on.

603
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:51,360
我们下车 别着急 然后慢慢往后走
We got to go. Walk toward the back.Just don't move too fast.

604
01:12:06,830 --> 01:12:08,460
好了，来吧
All right. Come.

605
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:26,600
－出租车 －这儿离郊区很远，看来坐地铁应该是最快的
BETTY: It is a long way uptown.I think the subway's probably quickest.

606
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,400
和几百个人挤在拥挤的车厢里
Me in a metal tube, deep underground,

607
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:31,940
我想我一定会被逼到发疯
with hundreds of people in the most aggressive city in the world?

608
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:34,690
没错 还是打车吧
Right. Let's get a cab.

609
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:38,990
拜托 快点儿 你开车就像个娘们
CAB DRlVER: Come on, now! Let's go!You're too slow! You drive like a woman!

610
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:45,500
- 看到没有 那可是个大美女  - 噢天啊
-Very nice. You see her? -Oh, my.

611
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:48,710
啊 你长眼睛了吗
Very pretty. Watch out, you goat!

612
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:50,830
呼吸，呼吸，呼吸
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

613
01:12:54,130 --> 01:12:56,800
你是脑子坏了吗
Are you out of your mind?

614
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,220
- 你有病啊？  - 怎么了，宝贝？
-What is wrong with you? -What's the matter, baby?

615
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:00,010
你不喜欢飙车吗？
You don't like a good ride?

616
01:13:01,850 --> 01:13:03,100
混蛋！
Asshole!

617
01:13:06,230 --> 01:13:08,730
知道吗 我可以教你一种非常有效的方法
You know, I know a few techniques could help you

618
01:13:08,810 --> 01:13:13,020
- 去控制自己的怒气  - 把嘴给我闭上 现在快走
-manage that anger very effectively. -You zip it. We're walking.

619
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,480
好的
Okay.

620
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:23,990
对不起，斯登博士吗？
Excuse me. Dr Sterns?

621
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,620
- 是  - 抱歉打扰你了，我是伊丽莎白·罗斯
-Yes. -I'm sorry to bother you. I'm Elizabeth Ross.

622
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:29,540
哦！罗斯博士！
Oh! Dr Ross!

623
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:32,540
- 我带了一个朋友来见你  - 好啊
-I have someone who'd like to meet you. -Okay.

624
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:36,510
你是蓝先生吗
It's Mr Blue, isn't it?

625
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:39,720
绿先生？
Mr Green?

626
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:45,640
我想告诉你，我我 我真的不知道会有真实的你存在
I got to tell you,I've been wondering if you were even real.

627
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:47,470
如果存在 你到底什么样
And if you were, what would it look like?

628
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:52,230
一个蕴藏着这么 强大力量的人
A person with that much power lurking in him.

629
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:53,940
竟然像你这么不起眼
Nothing could have surprised me more

630
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:56,900
没什么比这更能让我吃惊的事情了
than this unassuming man shaking my hand.

631
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:59,650
听着 这可不像是在公园里野餐
But, look. We're not strolling into the park for a picnic, here.

632
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:01,410
即便一切都很顺利
Even if everything goes perfectly,

633
01:14:01,490 --> 01:14:05,330
如果我们引导正确 如果我们使用了正确的剂量
if we induce an episode,if we get the dosage exactly right,

634
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:08,250
是会被永久治愈呢
is that going to be a lasting cure

635
01:14:08,330 --> 01:14:11,670
还是暂时的找到一种解药去抑制这样的变身 我…
or just some antidote to suppress that specific flare-up?

636
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,420
我不确定
I don't know.

637
01:14:16,170 --> 01:14:20,880
我要说的是，要是注射的剂量稍微多了那么一点点
What I'm saying is that if we overshoot this by even the smallest integer

638
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:26,720
我们做的是 需要处理毒素浓度 最为精确的平衡
we're dealing with concentrations with extraordinary levels of toxicity.

639
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:31,350
- 你是说他可能会死  - 死？当然，我 我应该先说
-You mean it could kill him. -Kill him? Yeah. I should say so.

640
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:35,190
所以你也该知道另一件事
You should know that there's a flip side to this, too.

641
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:38,820
要是完全相反 要是没有成功引导我的话
If we miss on the low side,if we induce me and it fails,

642
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:41,360
那么你就会陷入危险
this will be very dangerous for you.

643
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:47,200
听着，我一直都是一个好奇宝宝
Look. I've always been more curious than cautious,

644
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:51,540
从来没有出过事，那么可以开始了吗
and that's served me pretty well.So, are we going to do this?

645
01:15:46,590 --> 01:15:48,220
感觉怎么样？
How you feeling, man?

646
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:51,560
像个怪物
Like a monster.

647
01:16:11,450 --> 01:16:13,200
好了 躺下吧
Okay. On the table.

648
01:16:13,950 --> 01:16:19,340
这能保护你自己 如果你有强烈反应的话
These will protect you from yourself if you have a strong reaction.

649
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:23,550
希望到时候你别害怕
You can tell me later if you thought it was strong.

650
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:32,180
噢，拜托！这帮蠢到家的学生们
Oh, come on! Stupid graduate students.

651
01:16:36,810 --> 01:16:37,940
好
Okay...

652
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:39,980
你 你 你
You, you, you.

653
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:45,070
这将会是很新奇的感觉
This will be a somewhat novel sensation.

654
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:49,240
我们开始
We have begun.

655
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:54,120
透析机会混合解药和你的血液
The dialysis machine will mix the antidote with your blood.

656
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:58,670
但是要等你变身以后 解药才会产生作用
Except the antidote will only take hold once we've achieved a full reaction.

657
01:16:58,750 --> 01:16:59,920
放轻松
Just relax.

658
01:17:00,670 --> 01:17:04,000
好的 毕业作业完成了
Okay. We are comprehensive.

659
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:08,680
拿着
Here you go.

660
01:17:18,690 --> 01:17:20,690
好了，准备好了吗？
All right. We set to pop?

661
01:17:23,190 --> 01:17:25,360
你最好别碰他
I'd take your hands off him.

662
01:17:45,170 --> 01:17:47,210
我的老天哪
Oh, my God!

663
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:03,360
等等！还没结束
Wait, wait! There's more! Wait!

664
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:16,740
- 布鲁斯  -等一下
-Now. Okay, now! -STERNS: Wait.

665
01:18:16,830 --> 01:18:19,410
现在 快点儿 快啊
Now, do it! Do it!

666
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:29,420
布鲁斯！布鲁斯，看着我
Bruce! Bruce, look at me.

667
01:18:29,510 --> 01:18:34,010
我就在这儿 你快注射 快 斯登 快点儿注射
Stay with me. The antidote, now!Sterns, do it now!

668
01:18:35,470 --> 01:18:39,480
布鲁斯，看着我，看着我的眼睛 求你，看着我
Bruce, look at me. Look in my eyes.Please, look in my eyes.

669
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:43,100
你跟我开什么玩笑
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

670
01:19:02,710 --> 01:19:03,920
布鲁斯
Bruce.

671
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,380
我的天哪
Oh, my God.

672
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:19,770
布鲁斯？布鲁斯，能听得见吗？
Bruce? Bruce, can you hear me?

673
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:24,980
布鲁斯？
Bruce?

674
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:37,200
没事了，没事了
It's okay. You're okay. You're okay.

675
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:42,000
你成功了
You did it.

676
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:44,830
他没事，真是太棒了
He's fine. This is fantastic.

677
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:46,250
结束了
BETTY: It's over.

678
01:19:47,170 --> 01:19:48,250
嗨
Hi.

679
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:49,710
嗨
Hi.

680
01:19:58,050 --> 01:20:04,020
那是我这辈子见过最不寻常的事了 永远不会再有了
That was the most extraordinary thing I have seen in my entire life!

681
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:05,690
好了 知道吗 先停一下
Okay, you know what? Stop, please.

682
01:20:05,770 --> 01:20:08,150
我们得谈谈刚才到底发生了什么事
We need to go back and talk about what just happened in there.

683
01:20:08,230 --> 01:20:12,030
没问题 好的 伽玛射线存在于你的体内
Absolutely. Okay. The gamma pulse came from the amygdala.

684
01:20:12,110 --> 01:20:13,860
- 我认为罗斯博士的引导 - 你还好吗？
-I think Dr Ross's primer... -Are you okay?

685
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:17,200
让细胞暂时吸收了能量 所以它消退了
...lets the cells absorb the energy temporarily, and then it abates.

686
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,080
这就是为什么 你没在多年前死于辐射的原因！
That's why you didn't die of radiation sickness years ago!

687
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:22,870
现在，我们也许中和了这些细胞
Now, maybe we've neutralised those cells permanently,

688
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:24,870
但不知道是永久还是暂时的
or maybe we just suppressed that event.

689
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:27,290
我更倾向后者，但我也不能确定
I'm inclined to think the latter,but it's hard to know

690
01:20:27,370 --> 01:20:29,170
因为我的实验样本没一个活下来
because none of our test subjects ever survived.

691
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:30,880
- 当然它们没被引导… - 慢着 慢着 慢着
-Of course, they weren't getting the primer! -Wait, wait.

692
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,380
- 你说什么？ - 它们没有
-Wait, what did you just say? -They weren't getting

693
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:35,010
- 经过抑制引导 - 不不不，实验样本？
-the myostatin primer... -No, no, no. Test subjects?

694
01:20:36,050 --> 01:20:37,800
什么实验样本？
What test subjects?

695
01:20:38,510 --> 01:20:39,550
请跟我来
Come with me.

696
01:20:56,650 --> 01:21:00,570
- 布署得怎么样？ - 狙击手控制了A区
-SPARR: What's the activity level? -Snipers are covering Alpha sector.

697
01:21:01,410 --> 01:21:02,830
我们先用小白鼠做实验
STERNS ON RADIO.;We started on rats and mice,

698
01:21:02,910 --> 01:21:05,500
可是都死了 后来我们用了大一些的动物
but it just compIeteIy fried them,so we had to go bigger.

699
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:08,870
我们仍然不知道，是伽玛射线还是你的血更有毒
And we still don't know which is more toxic,the gamma or your blood.

700
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:12,710
- 什么意思？我的血？ - 布鲁斯，这都是你的样本
-What do you mean, my blood? -Bruce, this is all you.

701
01:21:13,550 --> 01:21:17,550
你寄给我的并不多，但我浓缩以后又制造了更多
You didn't send me much to work with,so I had to concentrate it and make more.

702
01:21:17,630 --> 01:21:20,890
只要继续研究就会有无穷的潜力
With a little more trial and error,there's no end to what we can do!

703
01:21:20,970 --> 01:21:24,680
这是神赐予我们的奇迹
This is potentially Olympian!

704
01:21:24,770 --> 01:21:28,270
这种伽玛科技有数不尽的用途 我们能发现
This gamma technology has limitless applications.

705
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:30,400
能发现几百种解药
We'll unlock hundreds of cures.

706
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:33,610
让人类可以对疾病完全免疫
We will make humans impervious to disease!

707
01:21:47,790 --> 01:21:49,460
不行，我们要销毁它
No, no, we've got to destroy it.

708
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,790
- 为什么？ - 所有的
-Wait, what? -All of it.

709
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,290
今晚必须把这一切
Tonight. We're gonna incinerate it.

710
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:55,630
- 全部销毁 - 我们…
-Is this the whole supply? -What...

711
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:57,260
会获诺贝尔奖的！
We could get the Nobel for this!

712
01:21:57,340 --> 01:21:59,550
你不了解它的力量 因为它
You don't understand the power of this thing.

713
01:21:59,630 --> 01:22:02,260
实在太危险，根本无法控制
It is too dangerous. It cannot be controlled.

714
01:22:02,930 --> 01:22:04,430
发现目标就射击
At your discretion, shooter.

715
01:22:04,510 --> 01:22:05,970
…我们三个可是发现了火种
STERNS ON RADIO.; ...three of us!This is Promethean fire!

716
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:07,100
BRUCE ON RADIO.; It's just...

717
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:08,430
无法瞄准
SOLDIER ON RADIO.; No shot.

718
01:22:11,770 --> 01:22:13,560
布朗斯基进去了
Blonsky's going in.

719
01:22:15,770 --> 01:22:18,650
布朗斯基，出来，我女儿在里面！
GENERAL.; Blonsky, stand down.My daughter's in there!

720
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:22,320
我们现在有解毒药
We have the antidote now.

721
01:22:22,410 --> 01:22:25,240
他们根本不要解药！他们要的是武器！
They don't want the antidote!They want to make it a weapon!

722
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:34,130
如果被政府拿走那就全完了
And if we let it go, we will never get it back.

723
01:22:34,340 --> 01:22:36,380
你不知道它的力量到底有多强大
You don't know how powerful this thing is.

724
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:38,460
我也像多数人一样讨厌那些人
I hate the government just as much as anyone,

725
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:40,340
不过你也未免太紧张了 不是吗
but you're being a little paranoid,don't you think?

726
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:49,640
布鲁斯！
Bruce! Bruce!

727
01:22:51,350 --> 01:22:52,600
快走
Get out.

728
01:22:55,860 --> 01:22:58,610
它在哪儿？说，它在哪儿？
Where is it? Come on, where is it?

729
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:04,490
让它出来
Show him to me.

730
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:07,280
布朗斯基！
Blonsky!

731
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:16,840
小姐！
SOLDIER: Miss!

732
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:19,710
穿上吧
Take this.

733
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:27,930
如果你敢销毁浩克 我就让你一辈子呆在牢里
If you took it from me, I'm gonna put you in a hole for the rest of your life.

734
01:23:33,690 --> 01:23:34,850
贝蒂
Betty.

735
01:23:36,810 --> 01:23:39,820
我永远都不会原谅你这么对他
I will never forgive what you've done to him.

736
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:41,240
他是一个逃犯
He's a fugitive.

737
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:43,280
就是你把他变成逃犯的
You made him a fugitive

738
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:46,870
为了掩饰你的失败 为了保护你自己
to cover your failures and to protect your career.

739
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:50,490
所以现在 我不想再当你的女儿了
Don't ever speak to me as your daughter again.

740
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:56,250
你要不是我的女儿，同样也会被捕的 懂吗
It's only because you're my daughter that you're not in handcuffs, too.

741
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:02,380
你说你能制造更多的它
SPARR: Are you telling me you can make more like him?

742
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:07,220
不！还不行，我是有一些资料 但还不能够
No! Not yet. I sorted out a few pieces,but it's not like I can put together

743
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:10,640
复制出这样的绿色大胖子 你明白了吗
the same Humpty Dumpty,if that's what you're asking.

744
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:14,600
它纯粹是个意外 我的目标是要做得更好
He was a freak accident!The goal is to do it better!

745
01:24:14,690 --> 01:24:16,600
所以班纳是唯一…
So Banner's the only...

746
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:24,820
- 她实在太罗嗦了  - 为什么 你老是要打人？
-She's an annoying bitch. -Why are you always hitting people?

747
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:32,330
要是我做了什么 惹毛了你 还请你多多原谅
Now what possibly could I have done to deserve such aggression?

748
01:24:32,410 --> 01:24:35,120
是你即将要做的事
It's not what you've done.It's what you're gonna do.

749
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:38,540
给我班纳身上提炼的东西
I want what you got out of Banner.I want that.

750
01:24:42,050 --> 01:24:46,090
你看上去已经注射了一些东西了 是吗
You look like you've got a little something in you already, don't you?

751
01:24:47,430 --> 01:24:51,060
我还要更多 你见过他变身了
I want more.You've seen what he becomes, right?

752
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:52,970
我见过
I have.

753
01:24:53,930 --> 01:24:55,480
简直太美了
And it's beautiful.

754
01:24:56,310 --> 01:24:57,560
像神一样
Godlike.

755
01:24:57,770 --> 01:24:59,480
我也要那样
Well, I want that.

756
01:25:01,650 --> 01:25:03,730
你必须把我变成那样
I need that. Make me that.

757
01:25:04,610 --> 01:25:07,610
我不知道你体内已经有什么东西了
I don't know what you've got inside you already.

758
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:09,280
要是混在一起
The mix could be

759
01:25:09,910 --> 01:25:11,450
会出乱子的
an abomination.

760
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:17,960
我没说 我不愿意
(GASPlNG) I didn't say I was unwilling.

761
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:22,250
我只是需要你亲口同意
I just need informed consent.

762
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:26,550
看来你同意了
And you've given it.

763
01:25:55,220 --> 01:25:58,120
m 0 0 l 60 0 60 60 0 60

764
01:25:55,220 --> 01:25:58,120
绿先生


批次：2058


强度：14.36%

765
01:26:07,670 --> 01:26:11,930
天啊 这就是我试着要跟你解释的
This is what I was trying to explain.

766
01:26:12,010 --> 01:26:16,930
我不知道你 到底注射了什么东西
I don't know what you've been ladling into yourself.

767
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:19,100
但是 有了效果
But clearly it worked.

768
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:22,810
我们假设 你现在听不懂我说什么 但…
Let's assume you don't understand a word I'm saying,

769
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:27,740
不过还是 请你躺回那张椅子上
but if you'll just get back on the table,

770
01:26:27,820 --> 01:26:30,320
让我 把你治好
I can fix this.

771
01:26:45,210 --> 01:26:46,920
SOLDIER 1 : Shoot it! SOLDIER 2: Hey!

772
01:26:47,710 --> 01:26:48,800
不
No!

773
01:26:58,390 --> 01:27:00,430
D队呼叫
SOLDIER 5: Delta 4 to Leader.

774
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:02,270
我们有两个人被杀了
They took out two of our guys,two of our guys!

775
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:05,060
布朗斯基跟中校还在里面！
Blonsky and the Major are still inside!

776
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:10,240
快点儿！上上上上
Come on! Move, move, move, move!

777
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:19,790
他在那儿！
It's over there!

778
01:27:21,580 --> 01:27:22,750
SOLDIER 2: Drop them!

779
01:27:22,830 --> 01:27:25,080
- 那是什么？  - 开枪！
SOLDIER 3: What is that thing? SOLDIER 4: Shoot it!

780
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:38,350
好吧！快！ 你 开车！我们走！快 快
Okay. All right! You... You, drive!Let's go! Move, move!

781
01:27:38,430 --> 01:27:39,770
快告诉队长
SOLDIER 5: Delta 4 to Leader!SOLDIER 6: Go, go, go, go, go!

782
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:41,770
有个大怪物跑出来了
SOLDIER 5: Something big just went off down here!

783
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:44,440
将军 你最好听听
General, you should hear this!

784
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:47,440
浩克在街上！重复，浩克在街上！
The Hulk is in the street!I repeat, the Hulk is in the street!

785
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:52,110
这不可能，你先冷静一下
That's impossible.You get a hold of yourself, young man.

786
01:27:52,190 --> 01:27:54,110
冷静一点儿 报告你的位置
You get it together. What is your position?

787
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:57,490
121街和百老汇路 北向路口
121st Street, heading north on Broadway!

788
01:27:57,570 --> 01:27:59,120
赶快调头
Turn us around.

789
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:09,300
我们调头了 为什么调头了
We're going back. Why are we going back?

790
01:28:09,380 --> 01:28:11,010
该死！把影像传给我！
Damn it! Give me eyes down there!

791
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:12,720
是，长官！
Yes, sir!

792
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:16,640
那是什么鬼东西？
What the hell was that?

793
01:28:16,970 --> 01:28:18,600
快 快
Go, go, go!

794
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:43,410
不！
No!

795
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:01,010
试验品
One of yours?

796
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:04,350
我的天啊 你做了什么？
Oh, my God. What have you done?

797
01:29:06,690 --> 01:29:08,520
开火！
OFFlCER: Fire at him, fire at him!

798
01:29:12,860 --> 01:29:14,940
你觉得他会怕子弹吗
Do you think a rifle's gonna hurt that?

799
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:16,610
来吧！
Come on!

800
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:21,280
宝贝儿
Sweet.

801
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,410
来吧
Booyah!

802
01:29:43,430 --> 01:29:44,770
赶快撤退
Get out of there, soldier!

803
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:49,730
Stacy!

804
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:22,300
给我一个像样的对手
Give me a real fight!

805
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:31,560
长官？
Sir?

806
01:30:34,230 --> 01:30:35,360
长官？
Sir?

807
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:39,900
下令把所有部队调到哈林区
Tell them to bring everything they've got and head for Harlem.

808
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:46,740
让我去吧 你把我送过去
It has to be me.You have to take me back there.

809
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:48,620
你在说什么？
What are you saying?

810
01:30:48,790 --> 01:30:50,080
你以为你能控制
You think you can control it?

811
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:53,290
不不不，不是控制，而是 我们可以利用它
No, no, not control it,but, I don't know, maybe aim it.

812
01:30:53,380 --> 01:30:54,840
要是不能控制呢
And what if you can't ?

813
01:30:56,380 --> 01:30:58,130
那个东西
We made this thing.

814
01:30:58,630 --> 01:30:59,970
是我们造的
All of us.

815
01:31:00,970 --> 01:31:02,180
求你了
Please.

816
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:09,640
- 降落在它附近 - 不不 留在空中
-Land us near it. -No, no. No, keep us high.

817
01:31:11,230 --> 01:31:12,560
打开舱门
Open the back door.

818
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:23,200
布鲁斯！布鲁斯，站住！停下！你在干嘛？
Bruce! Bruce, stop!Stop! What are you doing?

819
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:26,990
你得想清楚 你都不知道能不能变身！
Think about this!You don't even know if you'll change!

820
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:32,210
你不用这么做！求你了，这太疯狂了！
You don't have to do this!Please, this is insane!

821
01:31:32,290 --> 01:31:34,040
贝蒂，让我试试
Betty, I've got to try.

822
01:31:36,210 --> 01:31:37,540
对不起
I'm sorry.

823
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:01,860
哦 见鬼
Oh, shit!

824
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:08,700
- 把她拉进来！ - 进来，小姐
-Get her in here! -Come on, miss.

825
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:28,180
在那儿，贝蒂！
There. Betty!

826
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:48,780
浩克！
Hulk!

827
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:40,790
来呀！
Come on!

828
01:34:13,030 --> 01:34:14,990
就这点儿本事
Is that all you've got?

829
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:31,510
快用重火力 赶紧帮他一下
Use that thing, soldier! Give him some help!

830
01:34:31,590 --> 01:34:32,850
帮哪个？
Which one?

831
01:34:32,930 --> 01:34:35,260
帮绿色那一个，该死！快把另一个
Help the green one, damn it!Which one do you think?

832
01:34:35,350 --> 01:34:37,180
怪物打死
Cut the other one in half!

833
01:34:39,850 --> 01:34:41,020
罗斯！
Ross!

834
01:35:05,790 --> 01:35:07,550
继续开火
Keep it on him!

835
01:35:35,740 --> 01:35:38,740
- 我要迫降了！ - 抓紧！
PlLOT: Look, I got to put it down! GENERAL: Hang on!

836
01:36:45,980 --> 01:36:47,100
爸爸？
Dad?

837
01:36:49,730 --> 01:36:52,230
你受伤了吗？我来帮你
Are you hurt? Let me help you.

838
01:36:59,990 --> 01:37:01,870
我没事，想办法出去
I'm all right. Just find a way out.

839
01:37:49,710 --> 01:37:56,380
你不配拥有这种力量！看着她死吧！
