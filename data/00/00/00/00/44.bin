走
Go!

158
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,080
快跑
Move, move!

159
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,090
{\an2}{\pos(200,218)}谢谢

160
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,230
上
Go, go, go!

161
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,140
快走
Go! Go!

162
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,100
让开
Clear everyone out!

163
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,250
别跟丢了
Do not lose him!

164
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,150
不
No!

165
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,350
绕到他后面去
Get around behind him!

166
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,520
目标经过了抓捕车090
Target moving past mobile unit 0-9-0.

167
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,920
不
Oh, no.

168
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,820
开什么玩笑
You got to be kidding me.

169
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,450
-他在哪  -已发现目标
- Where is he? - Target acquired.

170
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,120
外国佬
Gringo!

171
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,560
走
Let's go.

172
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,350
不
No!

173
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,580
不要
Please! No!

174
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,160
别拿我电脑
Not the computer!

175
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:15,840
还给我
Gimme that!

176
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,710
不要
No!

177
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,110
{\an2}{\pos(200,218)}现在不那么厉害了吧

178
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,610
{\an2}{\pos(200,218)}再耍那些花哨的招数啊

179
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,440
{\an2}{\pos(200,218)}来啊

180
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,570
{\an2}{\pos(200,218)}停手吧  求你

181
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,280
{\an2}{\pos(200,218)}我  生气

182
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,410
{\an2}{\pos(200,218)}会非常糟糕

183
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,590
你生气糟糕  外国佬
You bad angry, g?

184
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,340
我生气才糟糕呢
I very bad angry.

185
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,100
不
Oh, no.

186
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:44,900
你不懂
You don't understand!

187
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,030
马上要发生非常糟糕的事了
Something really bad is about to happen here!

188
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,010
{\an2}{\pos(200,218)}是啊  非常糟

189
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,390
你们看到了吗
Anybody else seeing this?

190
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,060
有某种不明物体  请指示
We've got a bogey of some kind. Please advise.

191
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,210
那就是目标  把麻醉镖都打出去
That is the target! Use every tranq you've got!

192
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,330
马上
Do it now!

193
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,750
撤  撤  撤
Go live! Go live! Go live!

194
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,070
-快走  -快跑
- Move! - Get out of the way!

195
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,270
不
No!

196
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,600
它在我们后面  快走
It's behind us! Move! Move!

197
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,930
开火
Get him!

198
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,300
打他  开火
Shoot him. Shoot him!

199
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,800
离我远点
Leave me alone.

200
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,700
不
No! No!

201
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,220
我开枪之前就知道情况不对
I knew something was different before I got the shot off.

202
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,240
这是他跑掉之前身上带着的
He had it on him when he bolted.

203
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,320
那是他女朋友吗
Is that a girlfriend?

204
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,690
或许她在帮他
She helps him, maybe?

205
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,300
她已经不牵涉其中了
She is no longer a factor.

206
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,180
我们早就断绝了他们的往来  他是一个人
We closed that door to him a long time ago. He's alone.

207
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,170
他想一个人待着
He wants to be alone.

208
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:59,260
但查查看他有没有跟人联络
But see if he's been talking to anybody.

209
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:07,940
请原谅  长官
Forgive me, sir?

210
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:10,470
难道没人想谈谈
Doesn't anybody want to talk about

211
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,300
刚刚发生的情况吗
what went down in there? 'Cause...

212
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,560
他没有甩掉我们
He didn't lose us.

213
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,760
他也不是一个人  长官
And he was not alone, sir.

214
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,730
我们都围住他了
We had him.

215
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,510
然后我们被什么袭击了
And then something hit us, something...

216
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,110
很大块头的东西
Something big hit us!

217
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,500
他把叉车当垒球一般丢
It threw a forklift truck like it was a softball!

218
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:36,130
那是我见过的最强大的东西
It was the most powerful thing I've ever seen.

219
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,020
它跑了
Well, it's gone.

220
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,290
如果班纳知道它是什么
Well, if Banner knows what it is,

221
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,850
我要找到他
I'm gonna track him down,

222
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,450
拿我的脚踩着他的喉咙
I'm gonna put my foot on his throat

223
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,080
-然后  -那就是班纳
- and I'm gonna... - That was Banner.

224
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,220
它
It

225
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,520
就是班纳
was Banner.

226
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,980
你得解释这句话  长官
You have to explain that statement, sir.

227
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,130
不  我不用
No, I don't.

228
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,770
你干得很好
You've done a good job.

229
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,470
收拾东西  带我们的人上飞机
Pack up and get our men on a plane.

230
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:11,010
我们回家
We're going home.

231
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:03,800

Wait.

233
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,120
拜托
Please.

234
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,490
{\an2}{\pos(200,218)}可以帮我吗

235
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,150
{\an2}{\pos(200,218)}我不会说葡萄牙语

236
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,710
我在哪
Where am I?

237
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,410
{\an2}{\pos(200,218)}我在哪

238
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,370
{\an2}{\pos(200,218)}危地马拉

00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:37,370
{\an2}{\pos(200,218)}我要去附近小镇

240
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,880
{\an2}{\pos(200,218)}可以帮帮我吗

241
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,340
{\an2}{\pos(200,218)}上车吧

242
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,510
{\an2}{\pos(200,218)}来  披上这个

243
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,230
{\an2}{\pos(200,218)}你要去哪

244
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,400
{\an2}{\pos(200,218)}回家

245
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,380
我以前也曾在糟糕的任务中遭遇危险
I've run into bad situations on crap missions before.

246
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:08,680
我眼见好人牺牲
I've seen good men go down

247
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,950
就因为有人
purely because someone

248
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:12,160
不肯把情况如实告诉我们
didn't let us know what we were walking into.

249
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,420
但我继续下次任务
I've moved on to the next one,

250
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,570
因为这是我们的工作  是吧
because that's what we do, right?

251
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:15,860
职责如此
I mean, that's the job.

252
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,170
但这次
But this?

253
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:21,670
这是全新境界的奇怪
This is a whole new level of weird.

254
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,370
我不想就此不管
And I don't feel inclined to step away from it.

255
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,430
如果你要再去抓他  我加入
So if you're taking another crack at him, I want in.

256
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,520
恕我直言
And, with respect,

257
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,910
你应该找支准备充分  可以开战的队伍
you should be looking for a team that's prepped and ready to fight,

258
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,710
如果那玩意再次出现
because if that thing shows up again,

259
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,770
会有很多职业硬汉
you're gonna have a lot of professional tough guys

260
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,390
吓尿裤子
pissing in their pants.

261
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,740
长官
Sir.

262
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:50,450
{\an1}{\pos(35,222)}墨西哥  恰帕斯

264
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,320
嗯  完美
Yeah. Perfecto.

265
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,510
我要强调  我即将跟你说的
Let me emphasize that what I'm about to share with you

266
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:14,140
对于我个人和军队都非常敏感
is tremendously sensitive, both to me personally and the army.

267
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:17,860
你知道我们有
You're aware that we've got an

268
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,010
步兵武器开发项目
infantry weapons development program.

269
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:24,200
二战期间  他们启动了一项子项目
Well, in WWII, they initiated a subprogram

270
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,150
做生物科技力量强化
for bio-tech force enhancement.

271
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,730
超级士兵
Yeah, super soldier.

272
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:32,730
对
Yes.

273
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,140
虽然说得过于简单了  但没错
An oversimplification, but yes.

274
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,180
我把它翻了出来
And I dusted it off,

275
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,710
让他们认真研究了起来  大胆的研究
got 'em doing serious work again, bold work.

276
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,970
所有人都在努力增强士兵的装备
Across the hall, they were trying to arm you better.

277
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,250
而我们是想增强士兵本身
We were tryin' to make you better.

278
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:52,270
班纳的工作当时还在初期
Banner's work was very early phase.

279
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,540
甚至不涉及到武器应用
It wasn't even weapons application.

280
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,190
他以为他在研究辐射抗性
He thought he was working on radiation resistance.

281
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,950
我根本不会告诉他项目的真相
I wouId never have toId him what the project reaIIy was.

282
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,760
但他对自己的发现非常确信
But he was so sure of what he was onto,

283
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,860
于是拿自己做了测试
that he tested it on himself.

284
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,320
结果出了大岔子
And something went very wrong.

285
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,310
要么就是非常成功
Or it went very right.

286
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:13,940
在我看来
As far as I'm concerned,

287
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,750
他的身体都是美军的资产
that man's whole body is the property of the us army.

288
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:20,410
你说他没打算研发武器  是吧
You said he wasn't working on weapons, right?

289
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:22,640
-对  -但你是在研发武器  是吧
- No. - But you were. You were, weren't you?

290
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,150
你还试了别的东西
You were trying other things.

291
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,700
我们研发的一种血清
One serum we developed

292
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,250
非常有前景
was very promising.

293
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,420
他为什么跑了
So why did he run?

294
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,750
他是个科学家
He's a scientist.

295
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,100
他不是我们的人
He is not one of us.

296
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,660
布朗斯基  你多大  45吗
Blonsky, how old are you? 45?

297
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:43,850
39.

298
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,950
催人老啊  是吧
It takes a toll, doesn't it?

299
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,560
是啊

Sir?

444
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,410
爸爸
Dad!

445
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:32,170
爸爸  别这样
Dad, please don't do this.

446
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:34,360
你在这事上看不清楚  给我进去
You can't see this clearly. Now, get inside.

447
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,380
他在那里
There he is!

448
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,670
目标在天桥上  我们看到他了
Target is in the overpass. We have a visual.

449
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,100
不要与他接触  重复  不要与他接触
Do not engage! Repeat, do not engage!

450
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,720
他被包围了
He's locked in.

451
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,050
打两罐催泪瓦斯进去
Put two canisters in there with him.

452
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,270
开火
Fire!

453
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:17,860
把她拉回来
Get her back here!

454
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:53,530
这下她会看清了
Now she'll see.

455
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,260
A队
Alpha team?

456
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:20,520
全力攻击
Let him have all of it.

457
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,880
开火
Come on, light him up!

458
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:34,280
.50的枪呢  快过来
Where are the fifty cals? Move your asses!

459
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:24,370
天呐
Oh, my god!

460
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:29,000
布朗斯基  你上
Blonsky, now you're up!

461
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,250
长官
Sir?

462
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:32,540
掩护我
Cover me.

463
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:51,980
记得我吗
Remember me?

464
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:14,360
天呐  他真行
My god, he's doing it.

465
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:20,510
把他引到大炮附近
Move him toward the cannons!

466
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:27,380
快走
Move!

467
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:42,250
保持位置
Hold your position!

468
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:43,840
开始
Do it now!

469
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:11,020
求你  不要
Please, please, please, no!

470
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:12,290
-求你  不要  -把她拉开
- Please, please, please! - Get her back!

471
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:13,850
你要杀死他了
You're killing him!

472
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:16,030
停下  放开我
Stop! Get off of me!

473
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:17,600
布鲁斯
Bruce!

474
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:22,700
布鲁斯
Bruce!

475
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,900
布鲁斯
Bruce!

476
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:55,340
武装直升机呢
Where's the gunship?

477
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:16,120
这就完了
Is that it?

478
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,310
布朗斯基  马上撤
Blonsky, pull back now.

479
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:19,250
撤
Pull back!

480
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:23,910
你就这点本事了吗
Is that all you got?

481
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:33,010
撤
Fall back!

482
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:34,750
-撤  -我们走
- Fall back! - Let's go, let's go!

483
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:35,950
找掩护
Find cover!

484
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:41,440
贝蒂
Betty!

485
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,350
开火  该死
Fire, goddamn it!

486
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,190
布鲁斯
Bruce?

487
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,810
停火
Stop firing!

488
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:29,020
不
No!

489
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,860
你做得对  打给我们
You did the right thing, calling us.

490
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,200
我需要知道他们要去哪
I need to know where they're going.

491
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,760
只要她跟他在一起  就会非常危险
She'll be in incredible danger as long as she's with him.

492
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:29,910
谁对她有危险
From who?

493
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,620
他保护了她  而你差点害死她
He protected her. You almost killed her.

494
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:37,290
我保证  她的安全是我现在的首要考虑
I give you my word, her safety is my main concern at this point.

495
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:40,110
知道吗  我有一项职业的骄傲
You know, it's a point of professional pride with me

496
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:42,280
就是总能分辨出谎言
that I can always tell when somebody's lying.

497
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:45,150
你就在撒谎
And you are.

498
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:47,400
我不知道他要去哪
I don't know where he's going.

499
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,870
我知道如果她能  就会帮他
I know she'll help him, if she can.

500
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:52,670
那她就是在协助逃犯
Then she's aiding a fugitive.

501
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:56,390
那我就帮不了他俩了
And I can't help either one of them.

502
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:04,620
我以前还不明白她为什么从不谈起你
I used to wonder why she never talked about you.

503
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:06,680
现在我知道了
Now I know!

504
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:13,760
她是从哪认识的这些家伙
Where does she meet these guys?

505
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:04,750
布鲁斯
Bruce?

506
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,280
布鲁斯
Bruce.

507
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,950
没事的  没事
It's okay. It's okay.

508
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:54,640
过来  到这边来
Come here. Come this way.

509
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,790
小心头
Watch your head.

510
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:27,610
我们没事的
We're okay.

511
01:01:32,610 --> 01:01:33,570
没事的
It's okay.

512
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:37,190
只是下雨而已
It's just the rain.

513
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,270
他还能再走路吗
Will he ever walk again?

514
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:52,010
他身体里的大部分骨头现在都像碾碎的石头了
Most of the bones in his body look like crushed gravel right now.

515
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,790
我要承认  他的心脏像机器一样
I will say this for him. He's got a heart like a machine.

516
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:58,860
除了赛马  还从未见过这样的
Never seen anything like it, outside of a racehorse.

517
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,310
来
Here.

518
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:06,060
好了
Okay.

519
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:47,720
布鲁斯
Bruce?

520
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:52,370
你没事吧
Are you okay?

521
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:53,970
嗯
Yeah.

522
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:56,270
嗯  我感觉好多了
Yeah, actually, I feel a lot better.

523
01:03:56,730 --> 01:03:59,590
-很好  -我得把数据吐出来
- Good. - I just had to get my data back.

524
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:01,920
你把它吞下去了
You ate it?

525
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:03,500
是啊
Well, you know,

526
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:06,270
当时的情况得随机应变嘛
the circumstances called for a little improvisation.

527
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,880
他们的选择并不多
Okay, so they didn't have a great selection,

528
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,670
但我还是买了几件供你选
but I got you some options.

529
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:14,850
但首先
First thing's first.

530
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:17,460
不是吧
Oh, you're kidding me.

531
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:28,980
怎么了
What?

532
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:30,760
不要
No.

533
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:32,640
这是他们弹力最大的裤子了
They were the stretchiest pair they had.

534
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,160
我宁可碰运气
I'll take my chances.

535
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:43,560
{\an8}{\pos(343,224)}卡弗大学事件

关于今天早些时候

537
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:40,600
美国军队与不明敌人在卡弗大学校园内
between forces of the us military and an unknown adversary

538
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:43,650
发生激烈冲突的谣传仍甚嚣尘上
on the campus of Culver University earlier today.

539
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:44,920
二年级学生杰克·麦吉

和吉姆·威尔逊见证了部分战斗场面
Jim Wilson witnessed some of the battle.

541
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:48,570
它好大
It was so big.

542
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:51,620
-特别巨大  庞然大物[浩克]  -嗯
- It was like this huge, like, hulk! - Yeah.

543
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:54,610
麦吉碰巧是校报的记者
McGee, who happens to be a reporter for the campus paper,

544
01:04:54,610 --> 01:04:56,450
用手机拍下了这幅画面
captured this on his cell phone.

545
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:58,260
进一步对神秘"浩克"的搜索

548
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:06,290
{\an8}汽车旅馆

549
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:12,410
后面别剪太短了
Not too short back there.

550
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,620
我以前剪过的
I have done this before, you know.

551
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:34,290
真不知你这么久以来是怎么自己剪的
I don't know how you've done this on your own for all this time.

552
01:05:34,290 --> 01:05:36,270
一般是用大剪刀
With clippers, usually.

553
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,970
-等等  -怎么了
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait. - What? What?

554

我们不能这么做
We can't do this.

不行
No.

我不能
I can't.

558
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:47,590
我不能太激动
I can't get too excited.

559
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:52,020
一点点也不行吗
Not even a little excited?

560
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:56,430
没事的
It's okay.

561
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,350
长官  是布朗斯基
Sir, it's Blonsky.

562
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:08,000
有人去查过他有没有亲属家人什么的吗
Has anyone found out if he has next of kin or family?

563
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:10,410
您自己问他吧
Ask him yourself.

564
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:15,670
长官
Sir?

565
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:38,130
很高兴你恢复过来了  士兵
Good to see you back on your feet, soldier.

566
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:39,280
谢谢  长官
Thank you, sir.

567
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:48,260
你感觉如何
How do you feel?

568
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:52,470
很不爽  准备打第三轮了
Pissed off and ready for round three.

569
01:07:58,970 --> 01:08:01,270
简单说  这些我们都不能用
Basically, we can't use any of this,

570
01:08:01,270 --> 01:08:02,820
因为都可以被追踪
because they can track all of it.

571
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,640
那我的唇膏呢  也能被追踪吗
Well, my lip gloss? Can they track that?

572
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:09,120
不  你可以拿着你的唇膏
No. You can take your lip gloss.

574
01:08:10,070 --> 01:08:11,660
我还需要我的眼镜
Well, I need my glasses.

575
01:08:12,270 --> 01:08:13,420
你的眼镜和
Well, you can take your glasses

-手表可以拿  -好
- and your watch, okay? - Okay.

577
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:15,100
大部分都还能用
We can use most of it.

578
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,950
但是不能用信用卡  身份证和手机
We just can't use the credit cards, the ID or the phone.

579
01:08:17,950 --> 01:08:19,890
-打都不要打开  -好

580
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:22,480
现金也要拿着
And we'll take the cash, obviously.

581
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:24,040
只靠40美元  不用信用卡
How will we get where we need to go

582
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:26,380
我们怎么能到目的地
on $40 and no credit cards?

583
01:08:29,610 --> 01:08:31,750
我们可以卖了这个
Well, we could sell this.

584
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:36,420
不  你只有这一个她的遗物了  不行
No. No, that's the only thing you have left from her. No.

585
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:40,200
那我们就想办法再赎回来
Well, we'll have to try and get it back.

586
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:43,660
联邦机构已经在监控电话
Federal is already monitoring phones,

587
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:45,940
卡  和罗斯博士的网络账户
plastic and Dr. Ross's web accounts,

588
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:48,540
当地警方也对他们发出了通告
and local pd have been placed on alert.

589
01:08:48,570 --> 01:08:49,880
他们总会冒头的  到时候
They'll pop up somewhere and when they do,

590
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,050
我们就会马上知道
it comes straight to us.

591
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,860
他们不会冒头的
They're not gonna just pop up.

592
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,480
他撑了五年
He made it five years and

593
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,270
还跨越了国境  从不曾出错
got across borders without making any mistakes.

594
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:58,560
他不会现在开始用信用卡的
He's not gonna use a damn credit card now.

595
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,370
如果他想跑  那他早就跑了
If he was trying to escape, he'd be long gone.

596
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:01,730
他这次没想跑
He's not trying to escape this time.

597
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:04,120
他在寻求帮助  我们就这么抓住他
He's looking for help and that's how we're gonna get him.

598
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:05,400
我们知道他们想要什么
We know what they're after

599
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:06,630
我们知道他跟一个人有联络
and we know he's been talking to somebody.

600
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:08,780
你们都拿到了通讯记录的副本

If he comes up for air, we'll be waiting.

606
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:18,930
如果他出了声  我们会听到的
If he makes a peep, we'll hear him.

笑一个
Smile.

618
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:21,160
那是什么感觉
What is it like?

619
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:25,370
发生的时候  你有什么体验
When it happens, what do you experience?

620
01:10:26,530 --> 01:10:29,150
记得我们在哈佛志愿接受的实验吗
Remember those experiments we volunteered for at Harvard?

621
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:31,050
诱发幻觉的
Those induced hallucinations?

622
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:35,970
很像那个  但放大了一千倍
It's a lot like that, just a thousand times amplified.

623
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,270
就像有人往我脑子里倒了一升酸液
It's like someone's poured a liter of acid into my brain.

624
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:43,440
你记得任何事吗
Do you remember anything?

625
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:46,490
只有碎片  图像
Just fragments. Images.

626
01:10:46,650 --> 01:10:49,880
杂音太多  我无法从中得到什么
There's too much noise. I can never derive anything out of it.

627
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:52,050
但还是你在里面啊
But then it's still you inside it.

628
01:10:52,050 --> 01:10:54,040
不  不是的
No. No, it's not.

629
01:10:55,950 --> 01:11:00,360
我不知道  在洞里时  我真觉得它认识我
I don't know. In the cave, I really felt like it knew me.

630
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:02,340
或许你的心智还在其中
Maybe your mind is in there,

631
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:04,930
但被过载了  无法处理发生的情况
it's just overcharged and can't process what's happening.

632
01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:08,290
我不想控制它  我想摆脱它
I don't want to control it. I want to get rid of it.

633
01:11:21,670 --> 01:11:22,610
你准备好了吗
Are you ready?

634
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:24,940
我们来拉平差距吧
Let's even the playing field a little.

635
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:29,260
先生们
Gentlemen.

636
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:34,600
布鲁斯  醒醒
Bruce, wake up.

637
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:37,120
有情况
There's something going on.

638
01:11:40,190 --> 01:11:42,560
{\an8}准备停车

639
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,650
{\an8}前方施工

640
01:11:48,350 --> 01:11:51,170
我们得走了  走到后面去  别走太快
We got to go. Walk toward the back. Just don't move too fast.

641
01:12:06,870 --> 01:12:08,200
好  来
All right. Come.

642
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:24,040
去上城区好远啊
It is a long way uptown.

643
01:12:24,050 --> 01:12:26,150
坐地铁可能最快
I think the subway's probably quickest.

644
01:12:27,490 --> 01:12:29,250
我在钢管里  还在地下深处
Me in a metal tube, deep underground,

645
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:31,960
身边是最暴戾的城市里的几百个人
with hundreds of people in the most aggressive city in the world?

646
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:34,160
是啊  我们打车吧
Right. Let's get a cab.

647
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:39,180
快点啊  你太慢了  开车像个娘们
Come on, now! Let's go! You're too slow! You drive like a woman!

648
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:45,630
-好啊  看到她了吗  -老天
- Very nice. You see her? - Oh, my.

649
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:48,570
真漂亮  小心着点  小子
Very pretty. Watch out, you goat!

650
01:12:48,810 --> 01:12:50,790
呼吸  呼吸
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

651
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:56,440
你是疯了吗
Are you out of your mind?

652
01:12:56,820 --> 01:12:58,200
-你什么毛病  -怎么了  美女
- What is wrong with you? - What's the matter, baby?

653
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:59,830
不喜欢飞车吗
You don't like a good ride?

654
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:03,100
混蛋
Asshole!

655
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:08,780
我知道些技巧能帮你
You know, I know a few techniques could help you

656
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:10,150
有效地控制怒气
manage that anger very effectively.

657
01:13:10,150 --> 01:13:13,250
闭嘴  我们走路
You zip it. We're walking.

658
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:14,470
好
Okay.

659
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:23,990
打扰  史登博士吗
Excuse me. Dr. Sterns?

660
01:13:23,990 --> 01:13:25,110
-是  -抱歉打扰你
- Yes. - I'm sorry to bother you.

661
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:26,700
我是伊丽莎白·罗斯
I'm Elizabeth Ross.

662
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:29,480
罗斯博士
Dr. Ross!

663
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:31,580
我带来个人  他想见见你
I have someone who'd like to meet you.

664
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:32,700
好吧
Okay.

665
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:36,600
你是蓝先生吧
It's Mr. Blue, isn't it?

666
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:39,450
绿先生吗
Mr. Green?

667
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:45,640
我得告诉你  我还怀疑你是不是真的
I got to tell you, I've been wondering if you were even real.

668
01:13:45,650 --> 01:13:47,550
如果你是  那会是什么样
And if you were, what would it look like?

669
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:52,280
一个体内有那么强大力量的人
A person with that much power lurking in him.

670
01:13:52,290 --> 01:13:53,850
我真是万万没想到
Nothing could have surprised me more

671
01:13:53,850 --> 01:13:56,810
会是这么低调的人  跑来跟我握手
than this unassuming man shaking my hand.

672
01:13:56,910 --> 01:13:59,720
但是  这可不是什么简单的小事
But, look. We're not strolling into the park for a picnic, here.

673
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:01,510
就算一切顺利
Even if everything goes perfectly,

674
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:05,870
我们诱发了发作  并且准确调对了剂量
if we induce an episode, if we get the dosage exactly right,

675
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:08,340
那是能彻底治愈你
is that going to be a lasting cure

676
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:12,000
还是会成为一种解药  来抑制爆发
or just some antidote to suppress that specific flare-up?

677
01:14:13,970 --> 01:14:14,970
我也不知道
I don't know.

678
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:17,480
我是说
What I'm saying is that

679
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:21,340
如果我们稍有偏差
if we overshoot this by even the smallest integer

680
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:24,240
这种浓缩物
we're dealing with concentrations

681
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:26,880
可是毒性极强的
with extraordinary levels of toxicity.

682
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,070
你是说他可能因此而死
You mean it could kill him.

683
01:14:28,070 --> 01:14:29,430
死  没错
Kill him? Yeah.

684
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:31,700
可以这么说吧
I should say so.

685
01:14:32,990 --> 01:14:35,140
你要知道  还有另一方面的忧虑
You should know that there's a flip side to this, too.

686
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:36,550
如果剂量不够
If we miss on the low side,

687
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:38,870
如果诱发了发作  却不能控制
if we induce me and it fails,

688
01:14:38,870 --> 01:14:40,700
那对你可就相当危险了
this will be very dangerous for you.

689
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:47,080
听着  我一向是好奇大于谨慎
Look. I've always been more curious than cautious,

690
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:49,000
这对我来说挺好的
and that's served me pretty well.

691
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,380
所以  我们还做不做了
So, are we going to do this?

692
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:48,170
你感觉怎么样
How you feeling, man?

693
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:51,160
像个野兽
Like a monster.

694
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:12,970
好了  上去
Okay. On the table.

695
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:16,050
如果你反应激烈
These will protect you from yourself

696
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:19,930
这会保证你不会伤到自己
if you have a strong reaction.

697
01:16:20,670 --> 01:16:22,900
你回头再告诉我你觉得反应激不激烈吧
You can tell me later if you thought it was strong.

698
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:32,420
拜托  该死的蠢研究生
Oh, come on! Stupid graduate students.

699
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,060
好吧
Okay...

700
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:40,240
你  你  你
You, you, you.

701
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:45,220
这会是种新鲜的感觉
This will be a somewhat novel sensation.

702
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:48,770
开始了
We have begun.

703
01:16:51,110 --> 01:16:54,210
透析机会把解药跟你的血混合起来
The dialysis machine will mix the antidote with your blood.

704
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:55,920
但只有达到完全发作
Except the antidote will only take hold

705
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:58,160
解药才会生效
once we've achieved a full reaction.

706
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:00,050
放松
Just relax.

707
01:17:00,710 --> 01:17:04,450
好了  准备就绪
Okay. We are comprehensive.

708
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:08,470
给
Here you go.

709
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:20,870
好  可以开始了吗
All right. We set to pop?

710
01:17:23,230 --> 01:17:24,900
你最好别握着他了
I'd take your hands off him.

711
01:17:45,170 --> 01:17:47,370
天呐
Oh, my god!

712
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:03,150
等等  还没完  等等
Wait, wait! There's more! Wait!

713
01:18:14,170 --> 01:18:16,650
-好了  -等等
- Now. Okay, now! - Wait.

714
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:17,890
动手吧
Now, do it!

715
01:18:18,670 --> 01:18:19,640
开始
Do it!

716
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,960
布鲁斯  布鲁斯  看着我
Bruce! Bruce, look at me.

717
01:18:29,530 --> 01:18:32,200
坚持住  解药  快
Stay with me. The antidote, now!

718
01:18:32,710 --> 01:18:34,310
史登  快开始
Sterns, do it now!

719
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,700
布鲁斯  看着我  看着我的眼睛
Bruce, look at me. Look in my eyes.

720
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:39,650
请看着我的眼睛
Please, look in my eyes.

721
01:18:39,650 --> 01:18:42,010
开什么玩笑
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

722
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:03,660
布鲁斯
Bruce.

723
01:19:03,970 --> 01:19:05,370
天呐
Oh, my god.

724
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:17,770
布鲁斯
Bruce?

725
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,040
布鲁斯  听得到吗
Bruce, can you hear me?

726
01:19:23,890 --> 01:19:24,870
布鲁斯
Bruce?

727
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:34,830
没事了
It's okay.

728
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:36,060
你没事了
You're okay.

729
01:19:36,130 --> 01:19:37,160
你没事了
You're okay.

730
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:41,670
你做到了
You did it.

731
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:44,930
他没事  这太了不起了
He's fine. This is fantastic.

732
01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:45,970
结束了
It's over.

733
01:19:58,010 --> 01:20:01,240
那真是我这辈子见过的
That was the most extraordinary thing

734
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:04,010
最了不起的事了
I have seen in my entire life!

735
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:05,690
好了  停下吧  拜托
Okay, you know what? Stop, please.

736
01:20:05,690 --> 01:20:08,120
我们得谈谈刚刚发生的事
We need to go back and talk about what just happened in there.

737
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:09,590
当然  好
Absolutely. Okay.

738
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:12,010
伽马脉冲来自杏仁核
The gamma pulse came from the amygdala.

739
01:20:12,010 --> 01:20:13,540
-我觉得罗斯博士的引物  -你没事吧
- I think Dr. Ross's primer... - Are you okay?

740
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:16,150
让细胞暂时吸收了能量
...lets the cells absorb the energy temporarily,

741
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:17,080
然后它就消退了
and then it abates.

742
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:20,080
所以你多年前才没有死于辐射中毒
That's why you didn't die of radiation sickness years ago!

743
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,880
或许我们已经永久性地中和了细胞
Now, maybe we've neutralized those cells permanently,

744
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,840
也可能是抑制了爆发
or maybe we just suppressed that event.

745
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,160
我偏向于认为是后者  但很难确定
I'm inclined to think the latter, but it's hard to know

746
01:20:27,170 --> 01:20:29,330
因为我们的测试对象都没活下来过
because none of our test subjects ever survived.

747
01:20:29,330 --> 01:20:30,940
-当然了  他们没有引物  -等等
- Of course, they weren't getting the primer! - Wait, wait. Wait,

748
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:31,860
你刚刚说什么
what did you just say?

749
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:33,380
他们没注射肌肉生长抑制素引物
They weren't getting the myostatin primer...

750
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:34,870
不不  测试对象
No, no, no. Test subjects?

751
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:37,100
什么测试对象
What test subjects?

752
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:39,530
跟我来
Come with me.

753
01:20:56,650 --> 01:20:57,940
活动等级如何
What's the activity level?

754
01:20:57,940 --> 01:20:59,800
狙击手覆盖了A区
Snipers are covering Alpha sector.

755
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:02,730
我们首先拿老鼠做实验
We started on rats and mice,

756
01:21:02,730 --> 01:21:04,340
但它们都完全被烤死了
but it just completely fried them,

757
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:05,640
所以我们只能拿更大的东西实验
so we had to go bigger.

758
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:07,580
我们仍不知道哪个毒性更大
And we still don't know which is more toxic,

759
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:08,870
伽马射线  还是你的血
the gamma or your blood.

760
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:10,150
什么意思  我的血
What do you mean, my blood?

761
01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:12,810
布鲁斯  这都是你
Bruce, this is all you.

762
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:13,740
{\an8}绿先生
批号: 7754
强度: 1.08%

763
01:21:13,470 --> 01:21:14,810
你寄来的不够我研究
You didn't send me much to work with,

764
01:21:14,810 --> 01:21:17,130
我只好浓缩复制了
so I had to concentrate it and make more.

765
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:18,730
虽然经过了一番试错
With a little more trial and error,

766
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:20,780
但前途无可限量
there's no end to what we can do!

767
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:24,050
这可是潜力无量
This is potentially olympian!

768
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:28,160
这种伽马科技用途无限
This gamma technology has limitless applications.

769
01:21:28,230 --> 01:21:30,480
我们能制造数百种解药
We'll unlock hundreds of cures.

770
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:33,790
我们能让人类不怕疾病
We will make humans impervious to disease!

771
01:21:47,690 --> 01:21:49,400
不不  我们得销毁它
No, no, we've got to destroy it.

772
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:51,550
-等等  什么  -全部的
- Wait, what? - All of it.

773
01:21:51,810 --> 01:21:53,090
就今晚  全部焚毁
Tonight. We're gonna incinerate it.

774
01:21:53,090 --> 01:21:55,070
-所有的都在这里吗  -什么
- Is this the whole supply? - What...

775
01:21:55,570 --> 01:21:57,170
我们可以凭这个拿诺贝尔奖呢
We could get the nobel for this!

776
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:59,520
你不理解这玩意的威力
You don't understand the power of this thing.

777
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:02,310
太危险了  不可控制
It is too dangerous. It cannot be controlled.

778
01:22:02,890 --> 01:22:04,430
酌情处理  枪手
At your discretion, shooter.

779
01:22:04,430 --> 01:22:04,950
我们三个
...three of us!

780
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:07,030
-这是普罗米修斯之火  -这是...
- This is Promethean fire! - It's just...

781
01:22:07,030 --> 01:22:08,110
无法射击
No shot.

782
01:22:11,650 --> 01:22:13,030
布朗斯基进去了
Blonsky's going in.

783
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:18,240
布朗斯基  退下  我女儿还在里面
Blonsky, stand down. My daughter's in there!

784
01:22:21,150 --> 01:22:22,360
我们有解药了
We have the antidote now.

785
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:24,080
他们要的不是解药
They don't want the antidote!

786
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:25,730
他们要把它制成武器
They want to make it a weapon!

787
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:34,270
如果我们放走它  就永远别想追回来了
And if we let it go, we will never get it back.

788
01:22:34,270 --> 01:22:36,300
你根本不知道这玩意多强大
You don't know how powerful this thing is.

789
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:38,420
我跟别人一样痛恨政府
I hate the government just as much as anyone,

790
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:41,230
但你太多疑了吧
but you're being a little paranoid, don't you think?

791
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:49,640
布鲁斯  布鲁斯
Bruce! Bruce!

792
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:52,240
出去
Get out.

793
01:22:55,810 --> 01:22:58,750
它在哪  出来啊  它在哪
Where is it? Come on, where is it?

794
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,050
让他出来见我
Show him to me.

795
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:06,990
布朗斯基
Blonsky!

796
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,680
小姐
Miss!

797
01:23:18,330 --> 01:23:19,310
披上吧
Take this.

798
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:24,310
如果你夺走了它
If you took it from me,

799
01:23:24,310 --> 01:23:27,280
我就让你在牢里关一辈子
I'm gonna put you in a hole for the rest of your life.

800
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:34,620
贝蒂
Betty.

801
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:39,240
我永远不会原谅你对他做的事
I will never forgive what you've done to him.

802
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:41,200
他是个逃犯
He's a fugitive.

803
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:43,200
那是你害的
You made him a fugitive

804
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:47,180
好掩盖你的失败  保护你的事业
to cover your failures and to protect your career.

805
01:23:47,550 --> 01:23:50,150
永远别再把我当作你女儿了
Don't ever speak to me as your daughter again.

806
01:23:52,530 --> 01:23:54,050
就是因为你是我女儿
It's only because you're my daughter

807
01:23:54,050 --> 01:23:56,350
才没有也被铐起来
that you're not in handcuffs, too.

808
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:02,170
你是说你可以制造更多他那样的人吗
Are you telling me you can make more like him?

809
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:05,450
现在还不能  我是有一些碎片
No! Not yet. I sorted out a few pieces,

810
01:24:05,450 --> 01:24:08,750
但我并不能再组装出一个大怪物来
but it's not like I can put together the same humpty dumpty,

811
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:10,620
如果你是这个意思
if that's what you're asking.

812
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:14,620
他是个意外事故  目标是做得更好
He was a freak accident! The goal is to do it better!

813
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:15,980
那么班纳是唯一
So Banner's the only...

814
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:22,030
她真是个烦人的贱人
She's an annoying bitch.

815
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:25,100
你为什么总打人
Why are you always hitting people?

816
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:32,170
我做了什么  你要这么粗暴地对待我
Now what possibly could I have done to deserve such aggression?

817
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,770
不是你做了什么  是你要做什么
It's not what you've done. It's what you're gonna do.

818
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,300
我要你从班纳体内去掉的那东西
I want what you got out of Banner. I want that.

819
01:24:41,930 --> 01:24:42,970
看上去
You look like

820
01:24:42,970 --> 01:24:45,660
你体内已经注射了点什么了  是吧
you've got a little something in you already, don't you?

821
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:48,630
我还要更多
I want more.

822
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:51,270
你看到他会变成什么了  是吧
You've seen what he becomes, right?

823
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:52,910
是啊
I have

824
01:24:53,850 --> 01:24:55,320
它好美
and it's beautiful.

825
01:24:56,190 --> 01:24:57,330
像神一般
Godlike.

826
01:24:57,700 --> 01:24:59,030
我要那个
Well, I want that.

827
01:25:01,570 --> 01:25:03,470
我需要那个  把我变成那个
I need that. Make me that.

828
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:07,250
我不知道你已经注射了什么
I don't know what you've got inside you already.

829
01:25:07,610 --> 01:25:09,010
混合的产物可能会
The mix could be

830
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,360
令人憎恶
an abomination.

831
01:25:15,030 --> 01:25:18,080
我没说我不愿意
I didn't say I was unwilling.

832
01:25:18,410 --> 01:25:22,570
我只是需要你知情同意
I just need informed consent.

833
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:26,290
你同意了
And you've given it.

834
01:25:55,290 --> 01:25:58,170
{\an8}绿先生
批号: 2058
强度: 14.56%

835
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:11,550
我之前就是说这个
This is what I was trying to explain.

836
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:16,300
我不知道你已经注射了什么
I don't know what you've been ladling into yourself.

837
01:26:16,890 --> 01:26:19,050
但显然  很成功
But clearly it worked.

838
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:22,850
你大概是完全听不懂我的话吧
Let's assume you don't understand a word I'm saying,

839
01:26:22,850 --> 01:26:27,570
但麻烦你回到桌子上
but if you'll just get back on the table,

840
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:30,480
我可以修复你
I can fix this.

841
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:46,180
开枪
Shoot it!

842
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,110
不
No!

843
01:26:58,350 --> 01:26:59,760
D4呼叫指挥
Delta 4 to leader.

844
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,250
他们干掉了我们两个人  两个人
They took out two of our guys, two of our guys!

845
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:04,230
布朗斯基和少校还在里面
Blonsky and the major are still inside!

846
01:27:07,870 --> 01:27:10,440
走  上上上
Come on! Move, move, move, move!

847
01:27:18,290 --> 01:27:19,430
在那里
It's over there!

848
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:21,910
干掉他们
Drop them!

849
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:24,640
-那是什么  -开枪
- What is that thing? - Shoot it!

850
01:27:34,450 --> 01:27:38,340
好吧  你开车  我们走  走
Okay. All right! You... you, drive! Let's go! Move, move!

851
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:39,850
-D4呼叫指挥  -快走
- Delta 4 to leader! - Go, go, go, go, go!

852
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:41,830
这里出现了什么大家伙
Something big just went off down here!

853
01:27:42,230 --> 01:27:43,730
将军  您该来听听
General, you should hear this!

854
01:27:44,420 --> 01:27:47,640
浩克在街上  重复  浩克在街上
The hulk is in the street! I repeat, the hulk is in the street!

855
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:52,250
不可能  你镇定下来  年轻人
That's impossible. You get a hold of yourself, young man.

856
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:54,300
振作起来  你在什么位置
You get it together. What is your position?

857
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:57,470
121街  沿百老汇向北
121st street, heading north on Broadway!

858
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:58,780
调头
Turn us around.

859
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:08,490
我们回去了  为什么要回去
We're going back. Why are we going back?

860
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:11,390
该死  让我看下面的情况
Damn it! Give me eyes down there!

861
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:12,460
是  长官
Yes, sir!

862
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:16,330

不是控制它

我说不好  或许让它针对打击

You know, I hate to say, "I told you so," General,
